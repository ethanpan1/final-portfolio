          <h3>At a Glance</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I ran an end-to-end A/B test, collecting and analyzing data on user behavior as it responded to interface changes.</li>
            <li>My user group was cactus shop users, formed with my college peers.</li>
            <li>An A/B test allowed to quantify the impact of an interface and test intuitions for statistical significance.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="part">
          <h3>Part 1: Finding the Changes</h3>
          I first modified a template to create two versions of a cactus shop website. 
          These two versions would be used for our A/B test.

          <b>I was curious whether minute changes in the interface
          would have significant effects on the metrics I'd be testing.</b> As such, I
          changed the page subheading, the font of the price (italic vs. bold),
          and the color of the item count.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="part">
          <h3>Part 2: Finding Hypotheses</h3>
          I tested two metrics for my A/B test. The first was the <b>time to
          complete</b> the user task: adding at least $150 of cacti to the cart. The second
          was the <b>return rate</b>: how often users went to the checkout page and back
          to the buying page. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>I hypothesized users would spend less time buying cacti in interface B with the bolded price and a shorter subheading.</li>
            <li>I hypothesized users would return to the buying page more often in interface A with the colorful cart counts (since cart counts weren't available on the cart page).</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="part">
          <h3>Part 3: Finding Data</h3>
          I tasked users to add at least $150 worth of cacti to the cart. I fielded
          users through class as well as by messaging my friends. I then extracted user logs through
          Heroku and filtered them using a given script. I manually calculated each user's metrics
          and ran the aggregate data through my own script that applied the statistical tests.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="part">
          <h3>Part 4: The Findings</h3>
          I created an infographic to display the results of the tests. Interfaces A and B
          were not statistically different in time to completion or return rate.

        <br>
        <div class="part">
          <h3>Major Takeaways</h3>
          <b>It all comes down to sample size.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>My sample size was very low, so there wasnâ€™t enough statistical power to substantiate the observed difference in means.</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Natural user behavior is key.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>My users were not acting naturally, especially since my classmates participated in my A/B test among many others. This limited the results.</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Minor changes may not be do much.</b>
          <ul>
            <li>It is still unclear whether minute changes can have significant effects on user behavior. Larger design changes, like layout or navigation, are more likely to have significant effects.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>Next Steps</h3>
          To continue this project, I would collect more data and investigate larger changes in the interface. I would also access a more diverse set of users in the A/B test.s
